# Ultrasonic-Proximity-Detection-Circuit
Designed a proximity detection system using an ultrasonic sensor, 555 timer IC, comparator, and ESP32 microcontroller. The circuit sends ultrasonic pulses and processes received signals to detect objects within a set range. Detection alerts are indicated via LED and buzzer, with distance measurement functionality
